# **Assignment 5 ‚Äî Introduction to Databases and SQL**

## **Assignment Instructions**

You create your homework file in the `node-homework` folder.
First, create a new branch for this week's homework and name it `assignment5`.
Then, start `sqlcommand` as you did for the lesson. For each of the following tasks, you should get your SQL statements running in `sqlcommand` first, and then add them to your homework file. It may be helpful to have two terminal sessions open in VSCode - one for `sqlcommand`, and another to run your homework.
Next, create a file named `assignment5-sql.txt` within the `assignment5` directory. Each line in this file should be an SQL command, as described in the tasks.
Lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments.
As you add SQL commands to this file, you can test them with the following command:

```bash
npm run tdd assignment5
```

This test should be run from the `node-homework` root folder.

The [SQL section of w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) is a good reference to assist you with this assignment.

### **Preparation and Practice**

Within sqlcommand, practice doing various SQL statements: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK. Your practice SQL statements should also include statements that use JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, SUM, COUNT, etc. Continue practicing until you feel confident in your SQL skills. Remember that you can reload the database as needed. Also, practice writing subqueries as well. Then proceed to the following tasks.

**Note:** These tasks require SQL statements that are somewhat complicated. Implement the statements incrementally ‚Äî get one part working, then add more clauses, until everything works. If you run into problems, ask for assistance from a mentor or via the slack channel. If SQL is new to you, there is plenty to learn!

### **Task 1: Find the total price of each of the first 5 orders, ordered by order_id.**

There are several steps. You'll need to use the `price` from the `products` table and the `quantity` from the `line_items` table, so you'll need to join these with the `orders` table. You need to `GROUP BY` the `order_id`. You are grouping `line_items`. Also, `ORDER BY` the `order_id`. You need to select the `order_id` and the sum of the products price times the `line_items` quantity. The columns returned should be `order_id` and `total_price`. You use aliasing to specify total_price for the sum of price times quantity.

When you have this running in `sqlcommand`, add the SQL statement to `assignment5-sql.txt`.

Run the `tdd` test until the first test completes.

### **Task 2: Understanding Subqueries**

For each customer, find the average total price of their orders, and return the results ordered by customer name.

This can be done with a subquery. You first have to get the total price of each order, so you can reuse the statement from Task 1 for the subquery, with some changes. You are going to `JOIN` the customers table, which you need for the `customer_name`, with the results of the subquery. The changes you need to make are:

- You need to return the `customer_id` in the subquery, because you are going to `JOIN` the customers table to the subquery ON customer_id.
- You don't want `LIMIT` in the subquery, because you are going to get the total price for all orders.
- You don't need `ORDER BY` in the subquery, because at the end you will order by the customer name.

So, part of your statement will be:

```
... FROM customers c JOIN (subquery) AS t ON ...
```

After the ON clause, you `GROUP BY` customer_id and `ORDER BY` the customer_name. Note that you have two customer_id columns after the join, one being `customers.customer_id` and the other being `t.customer_id`, so you have to fully qualify your references to customer_id. Return the following columns: the customer name and the AVG of the total_price as `average_order_price`.

Once you have this running in `sqlcommand`, add the statement to `assignment5-sql.txt`. Run the `tdd` test until the second test completes.

### **Task 3: Creating a New Order**

Create a new order for the customer named Perez and Sons. The customer wants 10 of the 5 least expensive products. The employee to be associated with the order is Miranda Harris.

Follow these steps:

- Create the statement that finds the `customer_id` for Perez and Sons. Once it works in `sqlcommand`, add it to `assignment5-sql.txt`.
- Next, create a statement to find the `employee_id` for Miranda Harris. When that works, add it to `assignment5-sql.txt.`
- Next, write a query to find the `product_id` for the 5 least expensive products. Add that to the assignment file too.
- Then, start a transaction with `BEGIN`, followed by an `INSERT` for the orders record with a `RETURNING` for the `order_id`, followed by an `INSERT` for the 5 line_items corresponding to the 5 least expensive products. Finally, commit the transaction with `COMMIT`.
  Once you have this sequence working in `sqlcommand`, add all 4 statements to the assignment file.
- Finally, write a `SELECT` statement to find all `line_items` corresponding to the new `order_id`, and return all the columns for these records. When this works, add that statement to the assignment file.

Hint 1: When you are trying this out in `sqlcommand`, if you do `BEGIN` followed by the `INSERT` of the orders record, followed by the `INSERT` of the line_items records, followed by the `COMMIT`, then, because you are typing this all in manually, the transaction may time out before you get to the `COMMIT`. So, as you are trying things out in `sqlcommand`, do it without the `BEGIN` and the `COMMIT`. But be sure to include the `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` in your homework file.

Hint 2: You will put a statement into your homework file that adds the 5 line items. Please add all 5 line items with a single statement. Within that statement, you use the `order_id` that was obtained by `RETURNING` it from the insert of the orders record. For the tdd test, the `order_id` you put in your statement won't be used, because the test will insert a different orders record, and it will use the `order_id` for that record. This is done using a parameterized query, a technique you will eventually need to learn. This is what you'd actually do in a program. See [here.](https://node-postgres.com/features/queries)

Hint 3: You can use any date you like, but it should be a string of format YYYY-MM-DD.

Then run the `tdd` test until the third test completes.

### **Task 4: Aggregation with Having**

Find all employees who are associated with more than five orders. You want the `first_name`, the `last_name`, and the count of the orders, which you return as `order_count`. To achieve this, perform a `JOIN` on the employees and orders tables. Then use `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, and `HAVING` to filter the results, and sort them by `last_name`. Get this statement working in `sqlcommand`, and then add it to the assignment file.

Hint: You can't use `order_count` in your `HAVING` clause. You have to use `COUNT(order_id)` instead. Also, you can't use `last_name` in your `ORDER BY` clause. This is a subtle point. The problem is that there are multiple rows after the join with the same `last_name` and `employee_id` for the different orders, while your `GROUP BY` is based on `employees.employee_id`, not `last_name`. To handle this correctly, use `ORDER BY MIN(last_name)`.

Get this running in `sqlcommand`, and then add the line to your homework file.

Then run the `tdd` test until the fourth test completes.
