# **Assignment 11 ‚Äî Final Project**

## **Assignment Instructions**

Your assignment is to complete the final project and to prepare your final presentation.  If you have completed all assignments through assignment 10, you have completed a final project, except that we'd like you to do something extra if time permits.  The lesson contains some ideas for what you could do, or you may come up with a different idea.  You should only make changes to the back end, so that you are not distracted by React code.

Make your changes to an assignment11 branch of your node-homework repository.  Do a complete test. If you are adding or modifying APIs, test them.  If you are enabling Swagger, make sure that you can see the Swagger user interface.

**Important** Create a file in node-homework called project-summary.txt.  Include the URL of your deployed service on Render.com.  We hope that you do add some extra function.  If you do add extra function, describe what you added.  In particular, if you add or modify any REST APIs, document the new or modified APIS, with enough information that your reviewer can try them out: the path, the method, the query parameters if any, and the body if any.

## **Submit Your Assignment on GitHub**

üìå **Follow these steps to submit your work:**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Add, Commit, and Push Your Changes**

- Within your node-homework folder, do a git add and a git commit for the files you have created, so that they are added to the `assignment11` branch.
- Push that branch to GitHub.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Pull Request**

- Log on to your GitHub account.
- Open your `node-homework` repository.
- Select your `assignment11` branch. It should be one or several commits ahead of your main branch.
- Create a pull request. **Save the link to this pull request.**
- **Merge the pull request.**  In this one case, you do not wait for your reviewer.
- **On Render.com, open the dashboard for your service and do a manual deploy of the main branch.**
- **Test that everything works for your Render service, including any extra function you have added.**


#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Submit Your GitHub Link**

- Paste the URL of your pull request into the **assignment submission form**.  Your reviewer may look at the changes for the pull request or perhaps the entire main branch.
