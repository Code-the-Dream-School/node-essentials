# **Assignment 11 ‚Äî Final Project**

## **Assignment Instructions**

Your assignment is to complete the final project and to prepare your final presentation.  If you have completed all assignments through assignment 10, you have completed a final project, except that we'd like you to do something extra if time permits.  The lesson contains some ideas for what you could do, or you may come up with a different idea.  You should only make changes to the back end, so that you are not distracted by React code.

Make your changes to an assignment11 branch of your node-homework repository.
