# Week 1 Assignment: Intro to Node.js & Async JavaScript

> **Student Guidelines:**
> 1. **Clone** the `node-homework` repository to your local machine.
> 2. **Create a new branch** for your work on assignment 1 (e.g., `git checkout -b assignment1`).
> 3. **Put all your answers and code** in the `assignment1` folder and start working there.
> 4. After completing the tasks, **run the tests** using:
>    ```bash
>    npm run tdd assignment1
>    ```
> 5. Make sure to commit and push your changes to your branch.

> **Note:** You need to create a `sample-files` folder inside your `assignment1` directory to store the `.txt` files (such as `demo.txt`, `largefile.txt`, and `sample.txt`) used in the code examples and demos.
