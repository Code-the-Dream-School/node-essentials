# issue96-files

## Purpose of this directory

This directory is strictly for organizing my notes and thoughts; which will be used for the [Review, test and evaluate Week 6](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/node-essentials/issues/96) GitHub Issue. I created this directory

1. ~~to keep track of where I had left off for the day~~ and

2. to make any notes relevant to my completing the assignment and

3. to make any notes to help me understand the content better.

~~All that to say, this directory and its contents can be discarded.~~

## Explanation of files

<!-- TODO: remove this line below -->

./issue96-files/semi-complete-output.txt - the Terminal output from using Git and from using the commands in the assignment. This was documented for my own sake in case I needed to revisit it. It can be discarded and/or ignored.

./issue96-files/notes.md - The file I kept to document my thoughts as I worked on the Issue. Again, this file can be discarded and/or ignored.

./issue96-files/README.md - Created to explain the reason for this issue96-files/ directory. This file can be discarded and/or ignored.
