Contributing to the Node Curriculum

Thank you for helping improve the Code the Dream Node Curriculum! 🎉
Your contributions make a big difference in making sure this material is clear, accurate, and ready for our students.

🧠 Ways to Contribute

🧑‍💻 Code → Fix bugs, suggest features, adjust tests
📚 Curriculum → Improve lessons, add examples, clarify concepts
📝 Docs → Improve setup instructions
🧪 Testing → Add test coverage or identify bugs
🧑‍🏫 Student Support → Suggest tools or content to improve learning outcomes

📚 Repository Structure

We’ll be working with two repositories that serve different purposes:

node-essentials → Contains the core curriculum: lessons, assignment descriptions, mentor guidance, and sample answers. This repo also connects to the CTD Learns app.

node-homework → Contains student assignments and TDD test files for weekly work. Students clone this repo at the start of the course and push it to their own GitHub accounts.

🔄 Where to Contribute

Pull Requests (PRs)

Submit PRs to node-essentials for changes to lessons, assignments, curriculum content or answers to weekly assignments (for mentors to reference and guide students)

Submit PRs to node-homework if TDD tests need adjustments or additions.


Issues
